# Mini_Project_Programming
The program consists of a server and multiple clients.
It is a multiplayer 'HANGMAN' game, where the server provides the word for the users to guess.\
\
When connection to the server a message is displayed with the current game progress. This contains the current word, with letters appearing that have already been guessed and showing how many mistakes have been made.\

The user can then enter letters to guess what the final word is. These letters will then appear in the word or give a mistake.\

When either there are too many mistakes or the word is completed the game will reset and a new word is selected.
